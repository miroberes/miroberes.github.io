### Get yourself a linux machine

Find a way to run a linux machine, on which you will do all your training. This is non negotiable, if you are serious about knowing your tools. Which you should be.

This can be an old laptop or an old pc which you get for free from somewhere. It can even be a virtual machine running on your main workstation. The point is - **use linux to access all the labs you are going to do for the CKAD exam preparation**. And you are going to do labs, a lot of labs. You want to have all the linux commands stored in your muscle memory long before the exam.

You don't even need to use that linux machine directly. Access it remotely with RDP (renamed lately to Windows App for MacOS) from your main machine. You will be working in the same environment you will be using during the CKAD exam, with all the special linux commands and key combinations like for example Ctrl+Shift+V for pasting into the terminal.

### Get better at typing

Find one that suits your preferences, there are plenty of them. Or create your own typing exercises, you know the best where your weaknesses are. For me it is definitely typing numbers - and you will be typing numbers, for example port numbers.
